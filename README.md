Um. Ok. Well. This is a step by step guide to building and deploying your own Custom GPT and API with End to End ClearML integration. Fun stuff.

### [GPT 4 Description]
<img align="left" width="30" src="./presentation/gpt.png" /> 

Embark on a comprehensive journey to create, deploy, and leverage your very own Custom GPT and API, fully integrated with ClearML for a seamless experience. 

This step-by-step tutorial takes you through the entire process, starting with the construction of a robust PyTorch model that combines the prowess of a ``BERT/BiLSTM`` with the interpretability of an ``Explainable Boosting Machine`` (EBM) from InterpretML.

Discover how to bring your API to life using the power of ``HuggingFace``, ``PyTorch``, ``ClearML``, ``ClearML-Serving``, ``Docker``, ``NVIDIA Triton Inference``, and more ensuring your model is not just a marvel of machine learning but also a fully operational service. Dive into the world of custom GPT actions, designing a system that communicates effectively with your API, and explore the innovative concept of ``Retrieval Augmented Generation`` (RAG) to enhance your GPT's responses with real-time, llm based enhanced explainability.

Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or an enthusiastic beginner &#9996;, this guide promises to equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to bring your AI visions to reality.

Wow, right? 

&#9996; That last part may be off. This is not easy stuff. You will work at getting it all going if you wish to recreate it. But just dive into the areas that are new to you, and kick its ass.
