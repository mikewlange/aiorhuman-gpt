# Features and Descriptions

## `Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level`
This test gives a U.S. school grade level; for example, a score of 8 means that an eighth grader can understand the document. The lower the score, the easier it is to read the document. The formula for the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) is:

$
FKGL = 0.39 \left( \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{total sentences}} \right) + 11.8 \left( \frac{\text{total syllables}}{\text{total words}} \right) - 15.59
$

## `Gunning Fog Index`
The Gunning Fog Index is a readability test designed to estimate the years of formal education a person needs to understand a text on the first reading. The index uses the average sentence length (i.e., the number of words divided by the number of sentences) and the percentage of complex words (words with three or more syllables) to calculate the score. The higher the score, the more difficult the text is to understand.

$
GunningFog = 0.4 \left( \frac{\text{words}}{\text{sentences}} + 100 \left( \frac{\text{complex words}}{\text{words}} \right) \right)
$

In this formula:

-   "Words" is the total number of words in the text.
-   "Sentences" is the total number of sentences in the text.
-   "Complex words" are words with three or more syllables, not including proper nouns, familiar jargon or compound words, or common suffixes such as -es, -ed, or -ing as a syllable.

The Gunning Fog Index is particularly useful for ensuring that texts such as technical reports, business communications, and journalistic works are clear and understandable for the intended audience.

## `Coleman-Liau Index`
The Coleman-Liau Index is a readability metric that estimates the U.S. grade level needed to comprehend a text. Unlike other readability formulas, it relies on characters instead of syllables per word, which can be advantageous for processing efficiency. The index is calculated using the average number of letters per 100 words and the average number of sentences per 100 words.

$
CLI = 0.0588 \times L - 0.296 \times S - 15.8
$

Where:
-   L is the average number of letters per 100 words.
-   S is the average number of sentences per 100 words.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index)

## `SMOG Index`
The SMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook) Index is a measure of readability that estimates the years of education needed to understand a piece of writing. It is calculated using the number of polysyllable words and the number of sentences. The SMOG Index is considered accurate for texts intended for consumers.

$
SMOG = 1.043 \times \sqrt{M \times \frac{30}{S}} + 3.1291
$

-  M is the number of polysyllable words (words with three or more syllables).
-  S  is the number of sentences.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG)

## `Automated Readability Index (ARI)`
The Automated Readability Index is a readability test designed to gauge the understandability of a text. The formula outputs a number that approximates the grade level needed to comprehend the text. The ARI uses character counts, which makes it suitable for texts with a standard character-per-word ratio.

$
ARI = 4.71 \times \left( \frac{\text{characters}}{\text{words}} \right) + 0.5 \times \left( \frac{\text{words}}{\text{sentences}} \right) - 21.43
$

Where:

-   The number of characters is divided by the number of words.
-   The number of words is divided by the number of sentences.

Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index)

## `Dale-Chall Readability Score`
The Dale-Chall Readability Score is unique in that it uses a list of words that are familiar to fourth-grade American students. The score indicates how many years of schooling someone would need to understand the text. If the text contains more than 5% difficult words (words not on the Dale-Chall familiar words list), a penalty is added to the score.

$
DaleChall = 0.1579 \times \left( \frac{\text{difficult words}}{\text{total words}} \times 100 \right) + 0.0496 \times \left( \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{sentences}} \right)
$

$
\text{If difficult words} > 5\%: DaleChall = DaleChall + 3.6365
$

"Difficult words" are those not on the Dale-Chall list of familiar words.

## `Semantic Density`
Semantic Densityrefers to the concentration of meaning-bearing words within a text, a potential factor in differentiating between human-written and AI-generated essays. The process involves calculating the semantic density of essays by focusing on specific, meaning-rich parts of speech.</div>

**Calculating Semantic Density**: The function `calculate_semantic_density` computes this metric by determining the ratio of meaning-bearing words (identified by tags in `mb_tags`) to the total word count. A higher semantic density indicates a text that efficiently uses words with substantial meaning.

## `Semantic Flow Variability`

<div style="display: inline-block;padding: 10px;background-color: #f4f3ee;border: 1px solid #FF1493;border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom: 10px;line-height: 1.5;color: #333;" class="alert">This study examines the variation in <b>semantic flow</b> between sentences, a characteristic feature of human writing. For this analysis, the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from Sentence Transformers is utilized.

## `Psycholinguistic Features`

<span style="display: inline-block;padding: 10px;background-color: #f4f3ee;border: 1px solid #FF1493;border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom: 10px;line-height: 1.5;color: #333;" class="tip"><b>Psycholinguistic Features</b> encompass the linguistic and psychological characteristics evident in speech and writing. These features provide insights into the writer's or speaker's psychological state, cognitive processes, and social dynamics. Analysis in this domain often involves scrutinizing word choice, sentence structure, and language patterns to deduce emotions, attitudes, and personality traits.</span>

The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) [3] is a renowned computerized text analysis tool that categorizes words into psychologically meaningful groups. It assesses various aspects of a text, including emotional tone, cognitive processes, and structural elements, covering categories like positive and negative emotions, cognitive mechanisms, and more.

While LIWC is typically accessible through purchase or licensing, this project will employ Empath, an open-source alternative to LIWC, to conduct similar analyses.
The model's approach, based on contrastive learning, is key to its effectiveness. It excels in distinguishing sentence pairs from random samples, aligning closely with the study's objective to analyze semantic flow.

## `Textual Entropy`

<div style="display: inline-block;padding: 10px;background-color: #f4f3ee;border: 1px solid #FF1493;border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom: 10px;line-height: 1.5;color: #333;" class="alert"><b>Textual Entropy</b> involves measuring the unpredictability or randomness in a text. It is a metric for distinguishing between AI-generated text and human writing, as each may exhibit distinct entropy characteristics.</div>

The standard method for calculating entropy is outlined below, which evaluates the unpredictability of each character or word based on its frequency. This approach is encapsulated in the formula for Shannon Entropy:

$\begin{aligned}
H(T) &= -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i) &&\quad\text{(Shannon Entropy)} \\
\end{aligned}$

**Shannon Entropy** quantifies the level of information disorder or randomness, providing a mathematical framework to assess text complexity.

## `Syntactic Tree Patterns ` 

<span style="display: inline-block;padding: 10px;background-color: #f4f3ee;border: 1px solid #FF1493;border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom: 10px;line-height: 1.5;color: #333;" class="tip">

## Model - Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)
**A Balance of Predictive Power and Interpretability**

EBMs function like a choir 🎶, where each data feature represents a unique voice. These features individually contribute to the overall prediction, akin to each voice adding to the choir's harmony. This additive model approach ensures that the impact of each feature is distinct and quantifiable.

## Overview of EBMs
EBMs are an advanced form of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). They enhance predictive power while maintaining high interpretability by combining traditional machine learning techniques with the additive structure of GAMs. This design allows for a clear understanding of the influence of individual features and their combinations on the predicted outcome.

## Key Components of EBM
1. **Formula Representation**:
    $$
    g(E[y]) = \beta_0 + \sum f_i(x_i) + \sum f_{i,j}(x_i, x_j)
    $$
    - **g(E\[y\])**: Represents the transformed expected value of the target variable y.
    - **β₀**: The intercept term, indicating the baseline prediction without feature consideration.
    - **Σ fᵢ(xᵢ)**: Sum of functions for individual features, showing each feature's independent effect.
    - **Σ fᵢⱼ(xᵢ, xⱼ)**: Sum of pairwise interaction terms, capturing feature interactions.

2. **Training Process**:
    - EBMs learn shape functions fᵢ(xᵢ) and fᵢⱼ(xᵢ, xⱼ) for each feature and feature interaction through boosting. This technique incrementally refines the model by addressing previous iteration errors.

3. **Interpretability**:
    - Post-training, the model's terms are individually examined to understand their impact on predictions. This granular approach allows for detailed insights into how each feature (and pairs of features) affects the outcome.

4. **Feature Importance**:
    - The magnitude and shape of the learned functions provide a direct measure of feature significance. This aspect is crucial for identifying key influencers in the prediction process.

5. **Flexibility and Complexity**:
    - Despite its interpretability, EBMs can model complex nonlinear relationships and interactions, surpassing the capabilities of traditional linear models.


**☃** EBMs present a unique combination of high interpretability and predictive accuracy. This makes them ideal for scenarios where understanding the reasoning behind model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.
