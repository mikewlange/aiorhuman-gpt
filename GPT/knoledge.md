&#10077; Verily, the script before us, a modern parchment, doth invoke the spirits of computation to unravel the mysteries enfolded within its characters. Like Prospero's conjuring of airs and whispers, this code beckons forth answers from the aether, seeking knowledge with a sprite's swiftness. Yet not with charms or spells, but with the silent tongues of Python and OpenAI's grand oracle, it reveals its secrets. &#10078;

- The script creates an interactive widget within a Jupyter notebook that allows users to submit Python code for analysis.
- Upon clicking the "UNRAVEL MYSTERY" button, the code is sent to the OpenAI API, which uses the GPT-4 model to generate an explanation of the provided code snippet.
- The explanation is then displayed within the notebook, styled in Markdown for ease of reading.
- The function query_openai_api is responsible for communicating with the OpenAI API, handling the response, and formatting it as Markdown content.
- A loading icon is displayed while the API processes the request, providing visual feedback that the operation is in progress.
- The explain_code function sets up the interactive components, including the button and output area, and handles the button click event.
- The on_button_click function is the event handler that triggers the API call and manages the display of the loading icon and output.

### Note on Functionality
- **Current Limitation**: Presently, it works on a 'load-and-reveal' basis - I want it to stream. 
- **Future Updates**: Would like to get the streaming to work. :)

# Features Overview
- These are the features created and used by the EBM to generate a forcast. Used for explainability about the essay as well as the forcast. 

## Readability Scores
Content: We look at the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, Coleman-Liau Index,Automated Readability Index (ARI), Dale-Chall Readability Score scores of LLM-generated and human-written essays. The focus is on identifying distinct readability patterns characteristic of AI.
                

## Semantic Density
- Semantic Density refers to the concentration of meaning-bearing words within a text, a potential factor in differentiating between human-written and AI-generated essays. The process involves calculating the semantic density of essays by focusing on specific, meaning-rich parts of speech.


## Semantic Flow Variability
- This study examines the variation in semantic flow between sentences, a characteristic feature of human writing. For this analysis, the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from Sentence Transformers is utilized. Renowned for its efficiency in transforming sentences and paragraphs into 384-dimensional vectors, this model is particularly adept for clustering and semantic search applications. 

## Psycholinguistic Features
- Psycholinguistic Features encompass the linguistic and psychological characteristics evident in speech and writing.These features provide insights into the writer's or speaker's psychological state, cognitive processes,
and social dynamics. Analysis in this domain often involves scrutinizing word choice, sentence structure, and language patterns to deduce emotions, attitudes, and personality traits.

## Textual Entropy
- Textual Entropy involves measuring the unpredictability or randomness in a text. It is a metric fordistinguishing between AI-generated text and human writing, as each may exhibit distinct entropy characteristics.

## Syntactic Tree Patterns
- Syntactic Tree Pattern Analysis The analysis involves parsing essays into syntactic trees toobserve pattern frequencies and patterns,focusing on AI-generated and human-written text differences. This process employs the Berkeley Neural Parser, part of the Self-Attentive Parser suite. The code is designed to parse natural language texts, specifically our essay data, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

# Features and Descriptions

## `Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level`
This test gives a U.S. school grade level; for example, a score of 8 means that an eighth grader can understand the document. The lower the score, the easier it is to read the document. The formula for the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) is:

$
FKGL = 0.39 \left( \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{total sentences}} \right) + 11.8 \left( \frac{\text{total syllables}}{\text{total words}} \right) - 15.59
$

## `Gunning Fog Index`
The Gunning Fog Index is a readability test designed to estimate the years of formal education a person needs to understand a text on the first reading. The index uses the average sentence length (i.e., the number of words divided by the number of sentences) and the percentage of complex words (words with three or more syllables) to calculate the score. The higher the score, the more difficult the text is to understand.

$
GunningFog = 0.4 \left( \frac{\text{words}}{\text{sentences}} + 100 \left( \frac{\text{complex words}}{\text{words}} \right) \right)
$

In this formula:

-   "Words" is the total number of words in the text.
-   "Sentences" is the total number of sentences in the text.
-   "Complex words" are words with three or more syllables, not including proper nouns, familiar jargon or compound words, or common suffixes such as -es, -ed, or -ing as a syllable.

The Gunning Fog Index is particularly useful for ensuring that texts such as technical reports, business communications, and journalistic works are clear and understandable for the intended audience.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index)

## `Coleman-Liau Index`
The Coleman-Liau Index is a readability metric that estimates the U.S. grade level needed to comprehend a text. Unlike other readability formulas, it relies on characters instead of syllables per word, which can be advantageous for processing efficiency. The index is calculated using the average number of letters per 100 words and the average number of sentences per 100 words.

$
CLI = 0.0588 \times L - 0.296 \times S - 15.8
$

Where:
-   L is the average number of letters per 100 words.
-   S is the average number of sentences per 100 words.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index)

## `SMOG Index`
The SMOG (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook) Index is a measure of readability that estimates the years of education needed to understand a piece of writing. It is calculated using the number of polysyllable words and the number of sentences. The SMOG Index is considered accurate for texts intended for consumers.

$
SMOG = 1.043 \times \sqrt{M \times \frac{30}{S}} + 3.1291
$

-  M is the number of polysyllable words (words with three or more syllables).
-  S  is the number of sentences.

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG)

## `Automated Readability Index (ARI)`
The Automated Readability Index is a readability test designed to gauge the understandability of a text. The formula outputs a number that approximates the grade level needed to comprehend the text. The ARI uses character counts, which makes it suitable for texts with a standard character-per-word ratio.

$
ARI = 4.71 \times \left( \frac{\text{characters}}{\text{words}} \right) + 0.5 \times \left( \frac{\text{words}}{\text{sentences}} \right) - 21.43
$

Where:

-   The number of characters is divided by the number of words.
-   The number of words is divided by the number of sentences.

Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index)

## `Dale-Chall Readability Score`
The Dale-Chall Readability Score is unique in that it uses a list of words that are familiar to fourth-grade American students. The score indicates how many years of schooling someone would need to understand the text. If the text contains more than 5% difficult words (words not on the Dale-Chall familiar words list), a penalty is added to the score.

$
DaleChall = 0.1579 \times \left( \frac{\text{difficult words}}{\text{total words}} \times 100 \right) + 0.0496 \times \left( \frac{\text{total words}}{\text{sentences}} \right)
$

$
\text{If difficult words} > 5\%: DaleChall = DaleChall + 3.6365
$

"Difficult words" are those not on the Dale-Chall list of familiar words.

Source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale%E2%80%93Chall_readability_formula)

## `Semantic Density`
Semantic Densityrefers to the concentration of meaning-bearing words within a text, a potential factor in differentiating between human-written and AI-generated essays. The process involves calculating the semantic density of essays by focusing on specific, meaning-rich parts of speech.</div>

**Calculating Semantic Density**: The function `calculate_semantic_density` computes this metric by determining the ratio of meaning-bearing words (identified by tags in `mb_tags`) to the total word count. A higher semantic density indicates a text that efficiently uses words with substantial meaning.

## `Semantic Flow Variability`

<div style="display: inline-block;padding: 10px;background-color: #f4f3ee;border: 1px solid #FF1493;border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom: 10px;line-height: 1.5;color: #333;" class="alert">This study examines the variation in <b>semantic flow</b> between sentences, a characteristic feature of human writing. For this analysis, the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from Sentence Transformers is utilized. Renowned for its efficiency in transforming sentences and paragraphs into 384-dimensional vectors, this model is particularly adept for clustering and semantic search applications. Further details about the model can be found <a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">here.</a>
</div>

## `Psycholinguistic Features`

<span style="display: inline-block;padding: 10px;background-color: #f4f3ee;border: 1px solid #FF1493;border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom: 10px;line-height: 1.5;color: #333;" class="tip"><b>Psycholinguistic Features</b> encompass the linguistic and psychological characteristics evident in speech and writing. These features provide insights into the writer's or speaker's psychological state, cognitive processes, and social dynamics. Analysis in this domain often involves scrutinizing word choice, sentence structure, and language patterns to deduce emotions, attitudes, and personality traits.</span>

The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) [3] is a renowned computerized text analysis tool that categorizes words into psychologically meaningful groups. It assesses various aspects of a text, including emotional tone, cognitive processes, and structural elements, covering categories like positive and negative emotions, cognitive mechanisms, and more.

While LIWC is typically accessible through purchase or licensing, this project will employ Empath, an open-source alternative to LIWC, to conduct similar analyses.
The model's approach, based on contrastive learning, is key to its effectiveness. It excels in distinguishing sentence pairs from random samples, aligning closely with the study's objective to analyze semantic flow.

## `Textual Entropy`

<div style="display: inline-block;padding: 10px;background-color: #f4f3ee;border: 1px solid #FF1493;border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom: 10px;line-height: 1.5;color: #333;" class="alert"><b>Textual Entropy</b> involves measuring the unpredictability or randomness in a text. It is a metric for distinguishing between AI-generated text and human writing, as each may exhibit distinct entropy characteristics.</div>

The standard method for calculating entropy is outlined below, which evaluates the unpredictability of each character or word based on its frequency. This approach is encapsulated in the formula for Shannon Entropy:

$\begin{aligned}
H(T) &= -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i) \log_2 p(x_i) &&\quad\text{(Shannon Entropy)} \\
\end{aligned}$

**Shannon Entropy** quantifies the level of information disorder or randomness, providing a mathematical framework to assess text complexity.

## `Syntactic Tree Patterns ` 

<span style="display: inline-block;padding: 10px;background-color: #f4f3ee;border: 1px solid #FF1493;border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom: 10px;line-height: 1.5;color: #333;" class="tip">
<b>Syntactic Tree Pattern Analysis</b> The analysis involves parsing essays into syntactic trees to observe pattern frequencies and patterns, focusing on AI-generated and human-written text differences. This process employs the <a href="https://spacy.io/universe/project/self-attentive-parser">Berkeley Neural Parser</a>, part of the Self-Attentive Parser[5][6] suite. The code is designed to parse natural language texts, specifically our essay data, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. </span>

# Feature Distribution Statistics
- This is how to determine if a generated feature may potentially be useful in a model. 

>Is there a statistacally signifigant difference in feature x's distribution betwen LLM and Human?

Each of these measures provides a different perspective on the data, with the p-values offering
insights into statistical significance and the effect size measures (Cohen's d and Glass's delta)
providing information about the magnitude of the differences observed.

## Understanding Key Statistical Concepts
### T-Test p-value:
Purpose: Determines if differences between groups are statistically significant.
                        
Interpretation: A low p-value (< 0.05) suggests significant differences,
                          challenging the null hypothesis.

### Mann-Whitney U p-value:
Usage: Ideal for non-normally distributed data, comparing two independent
                          samples.
Significance: Similar to the T-test, a lower p-value indicates notable
                          differences between the groups.

### Kruskal-Wallis p-value:
Application: Used for comparing more than two independent samples.
Meaning: A low p-value implies significant variance in at least one of the
                          samples from the others.
### Cohen's d:
Function: Measures the standardized difference between two means.
Values: Interpreted as small (0.2), medium (0.5), or large (0.8) effects.

### Glass's delta:

- Comparison with Cohen's d: Similar in purpose but uses only the standard
                          deviation of one group for normalization.
Utility: Effective when the groups' standard deviations differ significantly.

- Note on Sample Size and Statistical Tests
Content: Small Samples (Under 5000 Records): T-Test, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests
                      are effective.
Large Samples (Over 5000 Records): Focus on effect sizes (Cohen's d
                      and Glass's delta), as p-values will generally approach 0.

# Model Overview

## Model - BERT-BiLSTM Classifier Model

> The BERT-BiLSTM Classifier model combines the BERT architecture with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, enhancing the model's ability to understand context and sequence in text. This model integrates BERT's transformer layers with a BiLSTM network, a dropout layer for regularization, and a fully connected linear layer with ReLU activation, culminating in a linear classification layer.

### Rationale

-   **BERT's Foundational Strength**: Utilizing the pre-trained BERT layers, the model leverages BERT's deep understanding of language semantics, gained from extensive training on diverse text corpora.
-   **Sequence and Context Awareness with BiLSTM**: The addition of BiLSTM layers enables the model to capture contextual information in both forward and backward directions, making it adept at understanding the sequence and flow of the text.
-   **Enhanced Text Processing Capabilities**: This architecture is particularly effective for complex classification tasks where understanding the context and sequence of words is crucial.

### Architecture

-   **Composition**: The model is composed of the BertModel layer followed by BiLSTM layers. This is further connected to a dropout layer for regularization, a fully connected linear layer with ReLU activation, and a final linear layer for classification.
-   **BiLSTM Configuration**: The BiLSTM layers are configured with customizable hidden sizes and layer counts, allowing the model to be adapted to different levels of sequence complexity.
-   **Loss and Optimization**: The model employs CrossEntropyLoss for loss computation and uses the AdamW optimizer. It focuses on optimizing metrics like accuracy and AUC, with an emphasis on balancing precision and recall.

### Adaptability and Use Cases

-   **Versatile for Various Text Data**: Given its enhanced contextual understanding, the BERT-BiLSTM Classifier is well-suited for tasks like sentiment analysis, topic classification, and other scenarios where the sequence of text plays a significant role.
-   **Customization and Flexibility**: The adjustable parameters of the BiLSTM layers (like hidden size and number of layers) offer flexibility, making the model adaptable to a wide range of text classification challenges.

## Model - Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)
**A Balance of Predictive Power and Interpretability**

EBMs function like a choir üé∂, where each data feature represents a unique voice. These features individually contribute to the overall prediction, akin to each voice adding to the choir's harmony. This additive model approach ensures that the impact of each feature is distinct and quantifiable.

## Overview of EBMs
EBMs are an advanced form of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). They enhance predictive power while maintaining high interpretability by combining traditional machine learning techniques with the additive structure of GAMs. This design allows for a clear understanding of the influence of individual features and their combinations on the predicted outcome.

## Key Components of EBM
1. **Formula Representation**:
    $$
    g(E[y]) = \beta_0 + \sum f_i(x_i) + \sum f_{i,j}(x_i, x_j)
    $$
    - **g(E\[y\])**: Represents the transformed expected value of the target variable y.
    - **Œ≤‚ÇÄ**: The intercept term, indicating the baseline prediction without feature consideration.
    - **Œ£ f·µ¢(x·µ¢)**: Sum of functions for individual features, showing each feature's independent effect.
    - **Œ£ f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º)**: Sum of pairwise interaction terms, capturing feature interactions.

2. **Training Process**:
    - EBMs learn shape functions f·µ¢(x·µ¢) and f·µ¢‚±º(x·µ¢, x‚±º) for each feature and feature interaction through boosting. This technique incrementally refines the model by addressing previous iteration errors.

3. **Interpretability**:
    - Post-training, the model's terms are individually examined to understand their impact on predictions. This granular approach allows for detailed insights into how each feature (and pairs of features) affects the outcome.

4. **Feature Importance**:
    - The magnitude and shape of the learned functions provide a direct measure of feature significance. This aspect is crucial for identifying key influencers in the prediction process.

5. **Flexibility and Complexity**:
    - Despite its interpretability, EBMs can model complex nonlinear relationships and interactions, surpassing the capabilities of traditional linear models.


**‚òÉ** EBMs present a unique combination of high interpretability and predictive accuracy. This makes them ideal for scenarios where understanding the reasoning behind model decisions is as critical as the decisions themselves.

### Top EBM Feature Distribution Plots

> Let's see if the top features used in the EBM are inline with our top features. If they have stars, then we're on the right track. 

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'names': [name.replace('_scaled', '') for name in ebm_global._internal_obj['overall']['names']],
    'scores': ebm_global._internal_obj['overall']['scores']
})

# Sort the dataframe by scores from highest to lowest
df_sorted = df.sort_values(by='scores', ascending=False)

# pull  15, the same as the UI shows above. 
features_to_plot = df_sorted['names'].head(15).tolist()
if(CFG.CLEARML_ON):
    clearml_ebm.log_data(data=features_to_plot,title='EBM Feature Importance List')

Test AI or Human

Dogs, often celebrated as humanity's best friend, hold a special place in many people's hearts, including mine. Their unwavering loyalty, boundless energy, and capacity for unconditional love make them more than just pets; they are cherished family members. What truly endears dogs to me is their ability to communicate without words, expressing joy, sadness, or empathy through their actions and expressions.

Dogs possess an innate ability to sense our emotions, providing comfort during our lows and joining in our highs with equal enthusiasm. This emotional bond is not just heartwarming but also psychologically beneficial, as interacting with dogs has been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. Their mere presence can uplift our spirits, making our homes feel more welcoming and alive.

Moreover, dogs encourage a healthier lifestyle. Regular walks and outdoor activities with them ensure that we get our daily dose of exercise, contributing to our physical well-being. These shared activities also strengthen the bond between us, creating a mutual understanding and respect that is both profound and unique.

The diversity among dog breeds is another aspect that fascinates me. From the tiny Chihuahua to the majestic Great Dane, each breed has its own distinct characteristics and charm, yet all share the same core qualities of loyalty and companionship. This variety means there's a dog out there for everyone, whether you prefer a laid-back companion or an energetic partner for adventures.

In conclusion, dogs are remarkable creatures that bring joy, companionship, and a sense of security into our lives. Their ability to connect with us on an emotional level, combined with their positive impact on our health and well-being, makes them truly invaluable companions. It's these qualities that make me deeply appreciate and love dogs.
